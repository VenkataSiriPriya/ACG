            <h4>Use Contrast Wisely</h4>
            <p>Ensure text stands out clearly against the background. High-contrast color schemes improve readability for users with low vision or color blindness.</p>
          </div>
          <div className="tip">
            <h4>Alt Text on Images</h4>
            <p>Include meaningful alt descriptions for every image. Screen readers use this information to convey image content to users who cannot see them.</p>
          </div>
          <div className="tip">
            <h4>Keyboard Navigation</h4>
            <p>Make sure users can navigate your entire interface using only the keyboard. Avoid traps and ensure focus indicators are clearly visible.</p>
          </div>
          <div className="tip">
            <h4>Descriptive Links</h4>
            <p>Use text that clearly explains where a link goes (e.g., “View Accessibility Tips” instead of “Click here”). This is essential for assistive technology.</p>
